DatePicker
----------

This component represents the date picker at the top of the Events screen.


componentWillMount()
--------------------

We keep track of the date passed in as a prop.


render()
--------

We generate the necessary date buttons - we create a button for the currently selected date, as well as three days in the past and three days in the future.


generateDateTile(offset)
------------------------

"offset" corresponds to the number of days in the past/future with respect to the date currently stored in "state". We create a "textViewStyle" depending on the offset (the central date should have a white circle around it). We then compute the date that should be displayed for this tile ("newDate").

We then create a button with the appropriate text, which when tapped, will do the following:

- Shifts the date stored in "state" by "offset"
- Tells the parent that the date has been updated
- Re-renders the component
