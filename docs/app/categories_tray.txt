CategoriesTray
--------------

This component displays a "tray" of categories, that scroll horizontally.

It is used to display event categories and sub-categories - depending on the type, it works slightly differently.


componentWillMount()
--------------------

If the props "categories" is defined, this means that we are in sub-category mode, so we should use the categories that are passed in from the parent. Otherwise, we need to send a request to get the event categories.

In both cases, we add a special "All" option with ID 0.


regenerateCategories()
----------------------

This method refreshes the categories stored in "state" by copying the categories passed in from "props" (and adding a special "All" category).


generateCategoryTiles()
-----------------------

If we have a "parentCategoryName", this means we are in sub-category mode. When switching parent category, the sub-category tray re-renders with a new "categories" prop - we therefore need to call "regenerateCategories()" to ensure consistency (i.e. to ensure that we show the correct sub-categories).

In either case, we then map the "state" categories to buttons - if a given category is the current one (i.e. index is the same as selectedIndex), we highlight it by setting its background colour to white and setting the text colour to orange.


render()
--------

If we are in sub-category mode, the parent component will pass in the current category to display as a prop (or "null" if it corresponds to "All") - in this case, we need to update "selectedIndex" accordingly.

We then render a simple ScrollView with the category buttons ("tiles").


onCategorySelected(category, index)
-----------------------------------

We tell the parent that the category has changed, and update the selected index.
